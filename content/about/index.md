This quote by the _Red Queen_ inspired Barnett and Hansen to publish the [Red Queen Effect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/red-queen-effect) which postulates that business must evolve just to stand still - and evolve even faster if it wants to get ahead. 

We've been working in startups for over 15 years (collectively nearer 50). It's fair to say we've experienced more than our share of the Red Queen Effect and learned to take advantage rather than let it overwhelm us.  

It's not easy and we've certainly got enough things wrong over the years so we started this blog to help us, and perhaps you, understand what's worked and what hasn't because just being "Good at tech" is not enough to bring a good idea to life. 

## Who are we ?
The best way to explain that is give you some idea of the kind of things we've done:

* Shown small & large development teams how to be efficient and how to measure they ways they work.
* Developed AI that can read human language and make simple decisions that have saved many thousands of hours of tedious work.
* Transformed the way startups walk & talk giving them just enough process to keep the momentum going but without killing the dream.
* Shown startups how to manage security effectively - just by being a little more organised.
* Democratised data so that it's avaliable for anyone on the team to understand and experiment with - not just the people creating reports.

## Who are you ? 

We love technology when it puts people in control, hate it when it takes-over or just exists for the sake of clever. 

This blog is for any manager, business owner, startup founder or tech leader that feels the right kind of ideas & technology could get more from the limited resources they already own.
